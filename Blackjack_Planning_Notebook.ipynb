    "# Console-Based Blackjack (21) — Merged Planning Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Game Strategy (Merged & Refined)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a **console-based Blackjack (21)** game written in Python. The goal is to simulate a simplified version of Blackjack with **one player versus the dealer**, using only core Python concepts: **lists, tuples, loops, conditionals, and functions**. No graphical interface is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is designed to be easy to understand both for the computer and for me as the programmer. Every part of the game is broken into small functions so the logic stays clean and readable (IB‑friendly and brain‑friendly).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Design Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cards** will be represented as **tuples** because their values never change. A card contains a rank and a value (for example: `('A', 11)` or `('7', 7)`).\n",
    "* The **deck** will be a **list** of card tuples because it changes constantly (shuffled, cards removed).\n",
    "* The **player’s hand** and **dealer’s hand** are also lists, since cards are added during the game.\n",
    "* **Aces** are handled carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * First, count all Aces as 11\n",
    "  * If the total goes over 21, reduce Ace values from 11 to 1 until the hand is legal again\n",
    "* The **player** chooses to *Hit* or *Stand* using input.\n",
    "* The **dealer** is automatic and keeps drawing cards until their total is at least 17.\n",
    "* The game runs in **rounds**, and the player can choose to play again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplifications (Intentional)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Face cards (J, Q, K) are treated as having a value of **10**\n",
    "* Only **one player vs dealer** (no multiplayer)\n",
    "* No betting system (focus is on logic, not money)\n",

    "1. Create the deck\n",

    "\n",
    "To make the game more interesting and to demonstrate control over game logic, the game will include **two difficulty levels** that the player can choose at the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 1: Normal Blackjack (Fair & Random)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The deck is fully random\n",
    "* Cards are drawn normally from the shuffled deck\n",
    "* The game behaves like standard Blackjack\n",
    "* No manipulation of outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "This level represents a **realistic and fair Blackjack simulation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Level 2: Fixed / Rigged Blackjack (Unfair Mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The game secretly tracks how many hands have been played\n",
    "* **Every 5 hands**, the game checks the player’s total\n",
    "* If the player’s hand value is **≥ 15**, the game forces a high-value card to be dealt\n",
    "* This increases the chance that the player will bust and lose\n",
    "\n",
    "This mode demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conditional logic\n",
    "* Game state tracking\n",
    "* Intentional manipulation of outcomes for learning purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "The rigged behavior will be clearly separated in logic so it does not affect Level 1.\n",

    "## 6. List of Changes Made When Merging Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "The following changes were made to combine the two original planning documents into one consistent design:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unified game scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Removed multiplayer logic from Document 2\n",
    "   * Final version uses **one player vs dealer**, matching Document 1\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standardized card representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Kept tuple-based card design from Document 1\n",
    "   * Simplified values using ideas from Document 2 (face cards = 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cleaned and merged function names**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Combined overlapping functions (`deal_card` / `draw_card`, `calculate_total` / `hand_value`)\n",
    "   * Renamed for clarity and consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Improved Ace-handling explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Used Document 2’s intuitive explanation\n",
    "   * Applied Document 1’s precise algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Structured game flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Converted Document 2’s sketch into a formal step-by-step flow\n",
    "   * Aligned it with IB-style planning expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Added difficulty levels**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Introduced a fair mode and a fixed (rigged) mode\n",
    "   * Clearly documented rules and behavior differences\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Removed unnecessary complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * No betting system\n",
    "   * No graphics\n",
    "   * Focus strictly on logic, structure, and learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Why This Structure Works (Reflection)\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure keeps the game **logical, readable, and modular**. Each function has a single responsibility, which makes debugging easier and keeps the code organized. The use of lists and tuples matches how cards and decks behave in real life, and loops handle repetition cleanly. Adding difficulty levels shows deeper understanding of conditional logic and program state, while still keeping the core Blackjack rules clear and controlled. This approach follows good programming practice and fits well with IB expectations for planning and problem decomposition.\n",
