    "So:\n",
    "- 4 Aces\n",
    "- 4 Twos\n",
    "- 4 Threes\n",

    "- If counting Ace as 11 puts the score over 21 → count it as 1\n",
    "- Otherwise → count it as 11\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A + 9 → 20 (Ace = 11)\n",
    "A + 9 + 5 → 15 (Ace = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Player decision: Hit or Stay\n",
    "Now you ask each player:\n",

    "If they choose Hit:\n",
    "- Give them one more card\n",
    "- Update their score\n",
    "- Show their new score\n",

    "\n",
    "If they choose Stay:\n",
    "- Their turn ends\n",
    "- Their score is saved\n",
    "- This repeats until:\n",
    "They stay\n",

    "\n",
    "Determine the winner\n",
    "Once all players are done:\n",
    "- Ignore players who went over 21 (they lost)\n",
    "- Compare the remaining scores\n",
    "- The player with the closest score to 21 wins\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone gets exactly 21, that's the best possible score\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, in conclusion all the game process that I will have to do to complete the game will be:\n",
    "1. Create the deck\n",
    "2. Shuffle the deck\n",
    "3. Choose number of players (1-4)\n",
    "4. Deal 2 cards to each player\n",
    "5. Calculate scores\n",
    "6. Ask players to Hit (keep going/add more cards) or Stay (keep the cards)\n",
    "7. Check if anyone goes over 21\n",
    "8. Compare final scores\n",
    "9. Announce the winner"
