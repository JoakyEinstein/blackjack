    "# Console-Based Blackjack (21) — Planning Notebook\n",

    "## Markdown Section 1: Game Strategy (In My Own Words)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will create a full console‑based Blackjack (21) game in Python using lists, tuples, loops, and functions. The game will simulate a single player versus the dealer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main ideas of my strategy:**\n",
    "- Represent each card as a **tuple** `(rank, suit)` so the card’s information is fixed and organized.\n",
    "- Store the deck as a **list** of card tuples. Shuffle it using `random.shuffle`.\n",
    "- The player’s hand and dealer’s hand will also be **lists** that grow as cards are dealt.\n",
    "- Use functions to break the game into small, clear responsibilities: building the deck, shuffling, drawing cards, calculating hand values, running the player turn, dealer turn, comparing results, and controlling the main game loop.\n",
    "- Aces will need special handling: count them as 1 first, then turn one Ace into 11 only if it doesn’t cause the hand to bust.\n",
    "- The game will use a **loop** to allow the player to play multiple rounds until they choose to stop.\n",
    "- The gameplay flow will be: create deck → shuffle → deal cards → player chooses hit/stand → dealer plays automatically → compare hands → display results → repeat.\n",

    "| `hand_value(hand)` | Calculate best Blackjack hand value (Ace = 1 or 11) | hand list | integer total + soft/hard info | lists, tuples | Add values, count Aces, convert Aces to 11 if it doesn’t bust |\n",
