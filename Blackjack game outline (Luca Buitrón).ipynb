    "\"\"\"First, to understand the Card values:\n",
    "Ace (A) → can be 1 or 11\n",
    "Cards 2–10 → keep their normal value\n",
    "(To keep it simple, I will ignore J, Q, K and instead make them count as 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "So this would mean that each card basically has:\n",
    "a name (A, 2, 3, … 10)\n",
    "a value (number)\n",

    "\"A\" → value = 1 or 11\n",

    "Before touching and doing any actual code, I really need to understand what is happening behind the scenes. Basically my goal is to make the program think like a simplified Blackjack dealer, using only lists, tuples, loops, and functions, and honestly trying not to make my computer explode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I want is the deck. For card values, I want them stored inside a tuple, because they never change. Like A is always 1 or 11, and the numbers are always what they are. So the tuple is like the sacred stone that never moves. Then I will multiply it by the number of suits. This gives me the full deck but as a list, because the deck itself changes. We remove cards, shuffle it, basically destroy the order, so that has to be a list. Once the deck exists, I shuffle it and deal two cards to everyone who is playing.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the deal, the real game starts. Each player has a hand stored in a list. I need to calculate the total, so I add up the values, but Aces are annoying because sometimes they are 11 and sometimes they are 1. So I will do the thing where you count how many aces you have and if your score goes over 21, you reduce them until your score is legal again. I kind of imagine the ace panicking and changing its identity to survive. Anyway, the player gets to choose if they want to hit or stand. If they hit, I append a card to their hand. If they stand, I move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dealer is boring because the dealer does not think. The dealer just keeps hitting until at least 17. This is super easy with a while loop. At the end, I compare the totals and figure out who wins. I need if statements for the busts, the blackjacks, the ties. After all this chaos, the main function will handle the whole flow like the boss of the program. Finally, I want everything structured nicely because IB likes structure and honestly my brain does too."

    "Player decision: Hit or Stay\n",

    "\n",
    "If they choose Stay:\n",
    "- Their turn ends\n",
    "- Their score is saved\n",
    "- This repeats until:\n",
    "They stay\n",
    "OR they go over 21\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the winner\n",
    "Once all players are done:\n",

    "- Compare the remaining scores\n",
    "- The player with the closest score to 21 wins\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone gets exactly 21, that's the best possible score\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, in conclusion all the game process that I will have to do to complete the game will be:\n",
    "1. Create the deck\n",
    "2. Shuffle the deck\n",
    "3. Choose number of players (1-4)\n",
    "4. Deal 2 cards to each player\n",
    "5. Calculate scores\n",
    "6. Ask players to Hit (keep going/add more cards) or Stay (keep the cards)\n",
    "7. Check if anyone goes over 21\n",
